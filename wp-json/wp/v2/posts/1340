Firstly, consider the arguments of these designers who are split over this unorthodox decor style.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"colorful-bathrooms-the-vote-apos-yes-apos-team\">COLOURFUL BATHROOMS: THE VOTE &#8216;YES&#8217; TEAM<\/h2>\n<p>&#8216;As people spend more time at home, we are reflecting on its potential and how it can be transformed to give a better lifestyle. Colour, pattern, and texture are simple and effective ways to do this,&#8217; open Alexander and Michael Christou, Founders and Directors of <a class=\"hawk-link-parsed\" href=\"http:\/\/www.161london.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-component=\"Inline Links\">1.61 London<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The designers continued, suggesting coloured sanitary-ware offers pockets of joy amid the pandemic when people are turning away from traditional ideas and are looking to brighten up their everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;People are bored with the stereotypical five-star bathroom style and want to bring more character, life, colour, and personality into their homes,&#8217; Alexander and Michael share.<\/p>\n<p>They continue: &#8216;People want to be bolder and expressive and create something unique to them and their space. That is why we see a big rise in vintage styles, patterns, and colour trends. Even the simplest and smallest design purchases can make a big aesthetic difference.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re keen to incorporate the rainbow in your bathroom but are still slightly reluctant to invest in colourful sanitary-ware, then the designers offered their expert suggestion on how to make a room more vibrant beyond the &#8217;80s craze.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;At 1.61 London, we still keep the sanitary-ware white but accentuate colour and pattern with different marble and porcelain colours and textures. We also incorporate a lot of metal beading with pops of brass and antique, rustic brass to give a design contrast.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;We love to section off specific areas in a bathroom, to give them their own design statement, like feature tiling a full shower area, or using a different toned marble with a specific type of texture or backlighting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Colourful, textured wallpaper with a pattern popping against a brass tap can create real individuality and character. It&#8217;s a bold move in the design industry narrative, but it&#8217;s very exciting and leaves all options on the table, and anyone can get involved,&#8217; they add.<\/p>\n<p>Alexander and Michael&#8217;s enthusiasm is equally mirrored by Louise Ashdown, head of design at West One Bathrooms. Louise offered similar advice for those who remain unconvinced by this nostalgic craze.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Colourful sanitary-ware is seeping back into bathrooms now, and we&#8217;ve had orders for stunning fittings in deep mustards, heritage greens, and teal blues. If you&#8217;re still sitting on the fence, go for white sanitary-ware with paintable exteriors, like cast-iron baths and [a] retro basin.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;For a more discreet colour pop, consider coloured brassware, like Viola&#8217;s classic HV1 basin tap, that comes in fiery orange and zingy limes,&#8217; Louise suggested.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"colorful-bathrooms-the-vote-apos-no-apos-team\">COLOURFUL BATHROOMS: THE VOTE &#8216;NO&#8217; TEAM<\/h2>\n<p>As with all bold trends, coloured sanitary-ware comes with its critics. While these designers are also fans of creating a bold and bright bathroom, they encourage us to take risks elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;I love using colour and encourage my clients to take a risk with wall tile and flooring, but I draw the line at colourful sinks and toilets. I think that craze is always short-lived. There are a lot of great design ideas we can take from the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, but that is not one of them,&#8217; announces Rande Leaman of the Los Angeles-based design company, Rande Leaman Interior Design.<\/p>\n<p>Rande&#8217;s argument is similarly mirrored by designer\u00a0Jeff Andrews who adds: &#8216;Bathrooms are a great place to personalise your design with the use of colour. I prefer introducing colour through tiles, stone, paint, or wallpaper and keep the other elements like tubs and sinks classic and subtle.&#8217;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"colorful-bathrooms-what-apos-s-your-vote\">COLOURFUL BATHROOMS: WHAT&#8217;S YOUR VOTE?<\/h2>\n<p>It appears the jury is out. If you&#8217;re looking to incorporate colour into your bathroom but want to avoid bright sanitary-ware, we suggest beginning with a bold wallpaper or tiles, and then see where you progress \u2013 but we would love to hear your thoughts on social media.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.homesandgardens.com\/news\/colorful-bathrooms-trend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Read the full article on Home &amp; Gardens here<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Colourful bathrooms \u2013 and in particularly, sanitary-ware, is set to be one of the biggest and most controversial of bathroom trends, as a growing number of homeowners inject elements of the kaleidoscopic 80s into their bathrooms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1341,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1340","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorised"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<title>Colourful bathrooms are on trend \u2013 but what do interior design experts think?
